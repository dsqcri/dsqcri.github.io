# 2D to Immersive video conversion

Immersive video content is experiencing a growing interest in the multimedia industry for some time now. Despite large investments from industraial giants, one problem remains that prevents immersive content from being adopted on an even wider scale; the lack of real content. The vast majority of
current immersive content is synthetic, generated by computer graphics models. The only approach for generating real content is through complicated hardware set-ups. Such set-up, can be composed of placing multiple cameras next to each other. This solution, however, requires upgrading the entire production pipeline which makes it expensive and impractical to be adopted on any large scale. 


## Project Overview

Current conversion methods porduce low-quality video results that exhibit artifacts. Such artifacts are not acceptable to many viewers. In this project we propose an automated system for converting the commonly accesable 2D video content into a multi-view, sterescocpic 3D format. Motivated by Qatar's hosting of 2022 World Cup, our system pays a special attention to soccer videos. Our system is also capable of handling a wider spectrum of sports games aswell as handling more generic content such as movies, TV programs and others.  

Our techniques are largely data-driven; we leverage the power of big data through the latest advances in A.I. and deep neural networks. This allows us to generate high quality conversion for wide spectrum of video content e.g. soccer, sports, movies and others.
