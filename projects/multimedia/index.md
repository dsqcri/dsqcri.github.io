# 2D to Immersive video conversion

Immersive video content is experiencing a growing interest in the multimedia industry for some time now. Despite large investments from industraial giants, one problem remains that prevents immersive content from being adopted on an even wider scale; the lack of real content. The vast majority of
current immersive content is synthetic, generated by computer graphics models. The only approach for generating real content is through complicated hardware set-ups. Such set-up, can be composed of placing multiple cameras next to each other. Such solution would require upgrading the entire production pipeline. This makes such solutions expensive and impractical to be adopted on any large scale. 


## Project Overview

In this project we propose an automated system for converting the commonly accesable 2D video content into a multi-view, sterescocpic 3D format. Motivated by Qatar's hosting of 2022 World Cup, we pay a special attention to handling soccer video games. Our techniques are also capable of handling a wider spectrum of sports games aswell as handling more generic content such as movies, TV programs and others. 

Current conversion methods porduce low-quality video results that exhibit artifacts. Such artifacts are not acceptable to many viewers. Our techniques are largely data-driven; we leverage the power of big data through the latest advances in A.I. and deep neural networks. This allows us to generate high quality conversion for different forms of data e.g. soccer, sports, movies and others.

 
## Cloud Service Overview

![multimedia](/projects/multimedia/system_architecture.png)

The figure above shows the high-level design of V3V system. The main goal of the system is to convert 2D video segments into 3D. The system consists of (i) server that receives a 2D video segment, converts it to 3D, and  provides a url for downloading the converted 3D segment, (ii) client application from which users can send 2D segments to the server and downloads the converted 3D segments.
 
As shown in the figure, the entry point to the server is the REST interface. The REST interface intercepts the requests coming to the server and passes them to the system in the form of actions. The REST interface logs the requests coming to it in a repository that is used to monitor the activity of the server. The repository is monitored by a system administrator who can also set some internal system parameters through web management console.

In order to serve concurrent requests from several clients in real time, the server has a module to provision on demand computing resources from public/private clouds. This module initializes a  cluster of machines for each client registered with the system. It balances the workload on the cluster, it can dynamically scale up/down cluster based on the processing requirements to meet the real time constraints. The module is designed to be independent of the APIs of the cloud providers.
