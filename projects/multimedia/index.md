  <figcaption> We present an automated system for converting the traditional 2D video feed into an immersive, sterescopic format.
The generated content can be observed on several devices such as card-boards, VR devices and S3D-enabled TVs and mobile phones. Our system aims to replace the usage of the complex hard-ware camera set-ups.</figcaption>

# 2D to Immersive video conversion

Immersive video is experiencing a growing interest for some time now. Despite large investments from industraial giants, one problem remains that prevents immersive video from being adopted on an even wider scale; the lack of real content. The vast majority of current immersive content is synthetic, generated by computer graphics models. The only approach for generating real content is through the use of complicated hardware set-ups. Such set-ups are often composed of multiple cameras stacked next to each other. Using the hardware solutions require upgrading the entire production pipeline which makes them expensive and impractical to be adopted on any large scale. 

## Project Overview

In this project we present an automated system for converting the commonly accesable 2D video content into a multi-view, sterescocpic 3D format. Current conversion methods porduce low-quality video results that exhibit artifacts. Such artifacts are not acceptable to many viewers. Our system is largely data-driven; we leverage the power of big data through the latest advances in A.I. and deep neural networks. This allows us to generate high quality conversion for wide spectrum of video content. 

Motivated by Qatar's hosting of the 2022 soccer World Cup, we pay a special attention to processing soccer videos. Our system is also capable of handling a wider spectrum of sports games and generic content such as movies, TV programs and others.
