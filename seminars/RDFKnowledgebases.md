## RDF Knowledge bases: endeavors to enrich structured Arabic content


### Speaker:

[Abdurrahman Ghanem]()

### Abstract:

In the era of data, structured content is very helpful to facilitate data processing and storage. RDF is a powerful and popular way to store, exchange, process and most importantly, preserve data semantics. There is an ongoing effort among the tech community, in various disciplinaries, to represent as much knowledge as possible in RDF format. This will help deeper processing of data such as performing inferences using the knowledge graphs.

There is shortage in the Arabic content among the most common knowledge bases. In my talk, I will present the portions of the Arabic content in Wikidata, Freebase, and DBPedia, the top three public knowledge bases. Afterwards, a quick overview will also be presented to show the most performant graph databases in the market. The results are based on importing the three Knowledge bases mentioned earlier. Finally, I will demonstrate our work-in-progress to transform unstructured Arabic content into RDF format to facilitate data processing and ultimately publish new RDF Arabic datasets to be used by the community.
